How-to:Holding the weight or object in front of your chest, stand with feet just outside hip width. Drive hips back and then down, as if sitting in a chair. Keep chest up and focus on your hips breaking below your knee crease. Push into heels, squeeze glutes (your booty!), and stand back up. Building strong legs with body weight can be challenging, however not impossible. Adding unilateral lower body movements, tempo training, positional pauses, and training to fatigue are just a few ways to increase lower body muscle mass without weights.
